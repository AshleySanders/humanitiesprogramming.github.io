Github is a website for you to share your code with the world. We've
been using the `git` program to revise our code thus far, but right now
it's only on our local computers. Github provides us with a simple way
to update and share our code with others. Remember, this is just the
source code, not the actual web application though. We'll get to
deploying the application to the web later.

Since we already created Github accounts, all we need to do here is
create a new repository and push our code to it.

## Github

* Create a new repo
* Add a README
* Push to the remote

## Branches

A sane branching technique

## Shortcuts

* `hub`
* `git flow`
