In the long run, chances are you (or someone else) will need to upgrade or fix
your application. Chances are you also won't remember all the details of your
application in a year when (and trust me, it's **when** not *if*) you need to
fix something. One of the biggest challenges to these fixes is that you can
sometimes fix one part of you application, but break another.

So how do you guard against this? One way is to write "tests" that allow you to
not only state the intent of your code, but also automates the system
validating that the code does what you intend.

> If you find yourself inheriting an application, writing tests is a good way
> to figure out what is going on in the application. When you change something
> you can update the application, you can also help ensure you don't break
> something else.
