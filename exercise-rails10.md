One of the things you want to be able to do is engage your users with your
application. For this application, allowing people to comment on a
transcription can go a long way in helping you engage your audience. This also
shows off how to associate a model with another (a very common task in web
development).

## Comments

A comment need to be associated with a particular transcription, and a user. In
Rails, these associations are handled at the application layer. If you've done
any database development before, you may have handled this at the database
layer.
