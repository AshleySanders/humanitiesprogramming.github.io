Running software on your computer is just one way to make sure your application
is working properly. However, chances are, your computer is not a server, and
there are a lot of different ways people might deploy your application. It's a
really good idea to have your tests run on a different server, maybe with
different versions of Ruby or database backends.

## Setup
.travis.yml

## Enable the Application
